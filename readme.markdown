# Readme

KB-Includes is a collection of classes developed as abstractions as I built my
WordPress plugins: classes doing essential work that seems to repeat across
plugins.

The documentation as well as an introduction to the classes can be found on the
[site](http://explog.in/kb-includes/) for these classes. The complete set is
licensed under GPLv2.

Please note that most of these classes are not stable at the moment: the list of
currently stable, and documented classes is as follows &mdash;
